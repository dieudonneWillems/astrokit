AstroKit
========

AstroKit is an Objective-C library for Mac OS X and iOS providing implementation of astronomical algorithms used 
in the calculation of the position of the planets and stars. It mostly follows the algorithms as layed out in Jean Meeus' 
Astronomical Algorithms, second edition 1998.

Documentation is available via the [wiki](https://github.com/lapsedPacifist/astrokit/wiki).
